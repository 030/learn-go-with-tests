# Roman Numerals

A number of companies will ask you to do the [Roman Numeral Kata](http://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/) as part of the interview process (not to me so far, but this is good practice for myself at least). This chapter will show how you can tackle it with TDD.

We are going to write a function which converts an Arabic number to a Roman Numeral. 

If you haven't heard of [Roman Numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals), it's how the Romans wrote down numbers.

`MCMLXXXIV` is 1984 for instance.

That looks complicated and it's hard to imagine how we can write code to figure this out right from the start but as this book stresses a key skill for software developers is to try and identify "thin vertical slices" of _useful_ functionality and then **iterating**. The TDD workflow shows us a clear path as to how to do this. 

So rather than 1984, let's start with 1.

## Write the test first

```go
func TestRomanNumerals(t *testing.T) {
	got := ConvertToRoman(1)
	want := "I"
	
	if got != want {
		t.Errorf("got '%s', want '%s'", got, want)
	}
}
```

If you've got this far in the book this is hopefully feeling very boring and routine to you. That's a good thing.

## Try to run the test

`./numeral_test.go:6:9: undefined: ConvertToRoman`

Let the compiler guide the way

## Write the minimal amount of code for the test to run and check the failing test output

Create our function but not make it pass yet, always make sure the tests fails how you expect

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {
	return ""
}
```

It should run now

```go
=== RUN   TestRomanNumerals
--- FAIL: TestRomanNumerals (0.00s)
    numeral_test.go:10: got '', want 'I'
FAIL
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {
	return "I"
}
```

## Refactor

Not much to refactor yet. 

_I know_ it feels weird just to hard-code the result but with TDD we want to stay out of "red" for as long as possible. It may _feel_ like we haven't accomplished much but we've defined our API and got a test capturing one of our rules; even if the "real" code is pretty dumb. 

Now use that uneasy feeling to write a new test to force us to write slightly less dumb code.

## Write the test first

We can use subtests to group our tests nice

```go
func TestRomanNumerals(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("1 gets converted to I", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := ConvertToRoman(1)
		want := "I"

		if got != want {
			t.Errorf("got '%s', want '%s'", got, want)
		}	
	})

	t.Run("2 gets converted to II", func(t *testing.T) {
		got := ConvertToRoman(2)
		want := "II"

		if got != want {
			t.Errorf("got '%s', want '%s'", got, want)
		}
	})
}
```

## Try to run the test

```
=== RUN   TestRomanNumerals/2_gets_converted_to_II
    --- FAIL: TestRomanNumerals/2_gets_converted_to_II (0.00s)
        numeral_test.go:20: got 'I', want 'II'
```

Not much surprise there

## Write enough code to make it pass

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {
	if arabic == 2 {
		return "II"
	}
	return "I"
}
```

Yup, it still feels like we're not actually tackling the problem. So we need to write more tests to drive us forward.

## Refactor

We have some repetition in our tests. When you're testing something which feels like it's a matter of "given input X, we expect Y" you should probably use table based tests.

```go
func TestRomanNumerals(t *testing.T) {
	cases := []struct {
		Description string
		Arabic      int
		Want        string
	}{
		{"1 gets converted to I", 1, "I"},
		{"2 gets converted to II", 2, "II"},
	}

	for _, test := range cases {
		t.Run(test.Description, func(t *testing.T) {
			got := ConvertToRoman(test.Arabic)
			if got != test.Want {
				t.Errorf("got '%s', want '%s'", got, test.Want)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

We can now easily add more cases without having to write any more test boilerplate.

Let's push on and go for 3

## Write the test first

Add the following to our cases

```go
{"3 gets converted to III", 3, "III"},
```

## Try to run the test

```
=== RUN   TestRomanNumerals/3_gets_converted_to_III
    --- FAIL: TestRomanNumerals/3_gets_converted_to_III (0.00s)
        numeral_test.go:20: got 'I', want 'III'
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {
	if arabic == 3 {
		return "III"
	}
	if arabic == 2 {
		return "II"
	}
	return "I"
}
```

## Refactor

OK so I'm starting to not enjoy these if statements and if you look at the code hard enough you can see that we're building a string of `I` based on the size of `arabic`. 

We "know" that for more complicated numbers we will be doing some kind of arithmetic and string concatenation.  

Let's try a refactor with these thoughts in mind, it _might not_ be suitable for the end solution but that's OK. We can always throw our code away and start afresh with the tests we have to guide us.

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {

	var result strings.Builder

	for i:=0; i<arabic; i++ {
		result.WriteString("I")
	}

	return result.String()
}
```

The code looks better to me and describes the domain _as we know it right now_.

### The Romans were into DRY too...

Things start getting more complicated now. The Romans in their wisdom thought repeating characters would become hard to read and count. So a rule with Roman Numerals is you cant have the same character repeated 3 times. Instead you take the next symbol and then "subtract" by putting a symbol to the left of it. 

For example `5` in Roman Numerals is `V`. To create 4 you do not do `IIII`, instead you do `IV`. 

## Write the test first

```go
{"4 gets converted to IV (cant repeat more than 3 times)", 4, "IV"},
```

## Try to run the test

```
=== RUN   TestRomanNumerals/4_gets_converted_to_IV_(cant_repeat_more_than_3_times)
    --- FAIL: TestRomanNumerals/4_gets_converted_to_IV_(cant_repeat_more_than_3_times) (0.00s)
        numeral_test.go:24: got 'IIII', want 'IV'
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {
	
	if arabic == 4 {
		return "IV"
	}

	var result strings.Builder

	for i:=0; i<arabic; i++ {
		result.WriteString("I")
	}

	return result.String()
}
```

## Refactor  

I dont "like" that we have broken our string building pattern and I want to carry on with it.

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {

	var result strings.Builder

	for i := arabic; i > 0; i-- {
		if i == 4 {
			result.WriteString("IV")
			break
		}
		result.WriteString("I")
	}

	return result.String()
}
```

In order for 4 to "fit" with my current thinking I now count down from the arabic number, adding symbols to our string as we progress. Not sure if this will work in the long run but let's see!

Let's make 5 work

## Write the test first

```go
{"5 gets converted to V", 5, "V"},
```

## Try to run the test

```
=== RUN   TestRomanNumerals/5_gets_converted_to_V
    --- FAIL: TestRomanNumerals/5_gets_converted_to_V (0.00s)
        numeral_test.go:25: got 'IIV', want 'V'
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

Just copy the approach we did for 4

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {

	var result strings.Builder

	for i := arabic; i > 0; i-- {
		if i == 5 {
			result.WriteString("V")
			break
		}
		if i == 4 {
			result.WriteString("IV")
			break
		}
		result.WriteString("I")
	}

	return result.String()
}
```

## Refactor

Repetition in loops like this are usually a sign of an abstraction waiting to be called out. Short-circuiting loops can be an effective tool for reabability but it could also be telling you something else.

We are looping over our arabic number and if we hit certain symbols we are calling `break` but what we are _really_ doing is subtracting over `i` in a ham-fisted manner.

```go
func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {

	var result strings.Builder

	for arabic > 0 {
		switch {
		case arabic > 4:
			result.WriteString("V")
			arabic -= 5
		case arabic > 3:
			result.WriteString("IV")
			arabic -= 4
		default:
			result.WriteString("I")
			arabic--
		}
	}

	return result.String()
}

```

- Given the signals I'm reading from our code, driven from our tests of some very basic scenarios I can see that to build a Roman Numeral I need to subtract from `arabic` as I apply symbols
- The `for` loop no longer relies on an `i` and instead we will keep building our string until we have subtracted enough symbols away from `arabic`.

I'm pretty sure this approach will be valid for 6 (VI), 7 (VII) and 8 (VIII) too. Nonetheless add the cases in to our test suite and check (I wont include the code for brevity, check the github for samples if you're unsure).

9 follows the same rule as 4 in that we should subtract `I` from the representation of the following number. 10 is represented in Roman Numerals with `X`; so therefore 9 should be `IX`.

## Write the test first

```go
{"9 gets converted to IX", 9, "IX"}
```
## Try to run the test

```
=== RUN   TestRomanNumerals/9_gets_converted_to_IX
    --- FAIL: TestRomanNumerals/9_gets_converted_to_IX (0.00s)
        numeral_test.go:29: got 'VIV', want 'IX'
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

We should be able to adopt the same approach as before

```go
case arabic > 8:
    result.WriteString("IX")
    arabic -= 9
```

## Refactor

It _feels_ like the code is still telling us there's a refactor somewhere but it's not totally obvious to me, so let's keep going. 

I'll skip the code for this too, but add to your test cases a test for `10` which should be `X` and make it pass before reading on.

Here are a few tests I added as I'm confident up to 39 our code should work

```go
{"10 gets converted to X", 10, "X"},
{"14 gets converted to XIV", 14, "XIV"},
{"18 gets converted to XVIII", 18, "XVIII"},
{"20 gets converted to XX", 20, "XX"},
{"39 gets converted to XXXIX", 39, "XXXIX"},
```

If you've ever done OO programming, you'll know that you should view `switch` statements with a bit of suspicion. Usually you are capturing a concept or data inside some imperative code when in fact it could be captured in a class structure instead. 

Go isn't strictly OO but that doesn't mean we ignore the lessons it offers entirely (as much as some would like to tell you). 

Our switch statement is describing some truths about Roman Numerals along with behaviour. 

We can refactor this by decoupling the data from the behaviour.

```go
type RomanNumeral struct {
	Value  int
	Symbol string
}

var RomanNumerals = []RomanNumeral {
	{10, "X"},
	{9, "IX"},
	{5, "V"},
	{4, "IV"},
	{1, "I"},
}

func ConvertToRoman(arabic int) string {

	var result strings.Builder

	for _, numeral := range RomanNumerals {
		for arabic >= numeral.Value {
			result.WriteString(numeral.Symbol)
			arabic -= numeral.Value
		}
	}

	return result.String()
}
```

This feels much better. We've declared some rules around the numerals as data rather than hidden in an algorithm and we can see how we just work through the arabic number, trying to add symbols to our result if they fit. 

Does this abstraction work for bigger numbers? Extend the test suite so it works for the Roman number for 50 which is `L`. 

Here are some test cases, try and make them pass.

```go
{"40 gets converted to XL", 40, "XL"},
{"47 gets converted to XLVII", 47, "XLVII"},
{"49 gets converted to XLIX", 49, "XLIX"},
{"50 gets converted to XLIX", 50, "L"},
``` 

If you're a cheater, all you needed to add to the `RomanNumerals` array is

```go
{50, "L"},
{40, "XL"},
```

## And the rest!

Here are the remaining symbols

| Arabic        | Roman           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 100     | C      |
| 500 | D      |
| 1000 | M      |

Take the same approach for the remaining symbols, it should just be a matter of adding data to both the tests are our array of symbols.

Does your code work for `1984`: `MCMLXXXIV` ?

Here is my final test suite

```go
func TestRomanNumerals(t *testing.T) {
	cases := []struct {
		Arabic int
		Roman  string
	}{
		{Arabic: 1, Roman: "I"},
		{Arabic: 2, Roman: "II"},
		{Arabic: 3, Roman: "III"},
		{Arabic: 4, Roman: "IV"},
		{Arabic: 5, Roman: "V"},
		{Arabic: 6, Roman: "VI"},
		{Arabic: 7, Roman: "VII"},
		{Arabic: 8, Roman: "VIII"},
		{Arabic: 9, Roman: "IX"},
		{Arabic: 10, Roman: "X"},
		{Arabic: 14, Roman: "XIV"},
		{Arabic: 18, Roman: "XVIII"},
		{Arabic: 20, Roman: "XX"},
		{Arabic: 39, Roman: "XXXIX"},
		{Arabic: 40, Roman: "XL"},
		{Arabic: 47, Roman: "XLVII"},
		{Arabic: 49, Roman: "XLIX"},
		{Arabic: 50, Roman: "L"},
		{Arabic: 100, Roman: "C"},
		{Arabic: 90, Roman: "XC"},
		{Arabic: 400, Roman: "CD"},
		{Arabic: 500, Roman: "D"},
		{Arabic: 900, Roman: "CM"},
		{Arabic: 1000, Roman: "M"},
		{Arabic: 1984, Roman: "MCMLXXXIV"},
		{Arabic: 3999, Roman: "MMMCMXCIX"},
		{Arabic: 2014, Roman: "MMXIV"},
		{Arabic: 1006, Roman: "MVI"},
		{Arabic: 798, Roman: "DCCXCVIII"},
	}
	for _, test := range cases {
		t.Run(fmt.Sprintf("%d gets converted to '%s", test.Arabic, test.Roman), func(t *testing.T) {
			got := ConvertToRoman(test.Arabic)
			if got != test.Roman {
				t.Errorf("got '%s', want '%s'", got, test.Roman)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

- I removed `description` as I felt the _data_ described enough of the information. 
- I added a few other edge cases I found just to give me a little more confidence. With table based tests it's very cheap to do.

I didn't change the algorithm at all, all I had to do was update the `RomanNumerals` array.

```go
var RomanNumerals = []RomanNumeral{
	{1000, "M"},
	{900, "CM"},
	{500, "D"},
	{400, "CD"},
	{100, "C"},
	{90, "XC"},
	{50, "L"},
	{40, "XL"},
	{10, "X"},
	{9, "IX"},
	{5, "V"},
	{4, "IV"},
	{1, "I"},
}
```

## Wrapping up

Nothing new in this chapter, just more TDD practice! 

Did the thought of writing code that converts 1984 into MCMLXXXIV feel intimidating to you at first? It did to me and I've been writing software for quite a long time. 

The trick, as always is to **get started with something simple** and take **small steps**. 

At no point in this process did we make any large leaps, do any huge refactorings or get in a mess.

I can hear someone cynically saying "this is just a kata". I cant argue with that, but every project I work on I still take this same approach. I never ship a big distributed system in my first step, I find the simplest thing the team could ship (usually a "Hello world" website) and then iterate on small bits of functionality in manageable chunks, just like how we did here.

The skill is knowing _how_ to split work up, and that comes with practice and with some lovely TDD to help you on your way.
